        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>

          <br>
          
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>

          <br>
          
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements which define a section in a document with thematic content</li>

          <br>
          
          <li>Semantic elements have names which describe its content and its role within a webpage. Semantic elements make a webpage more accesible and easier to read for other developers and also the browser</li>

          <br>
          
          <li>Anything within the head element will not be displayed for the end user, it contains metadata for use by the browser</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>

          <br>
          
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <br>
          
          <li>A period designates a term as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the stated class, e.g. .card  would gain the property assignments from the CSS</li>

          <br>
          
          <li> There are three main methods to incorporate CSS into a html webpage, inline CSS which styles an element directly in the HTML file, an internal style sheet which contains css rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file, the rules only apply to that page. Lastly, there is the external CSS style sheet, this is preferred in most cases as it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file.</li>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>

        <ul>
          
          <li>A variable "var" is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>

          <br>
          
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        
          <br>
          
          <li>Console.log outputs a message to the web console by adding an arguement, e.g. console.log(topics); will putput the value of the topics variable as it is included inside the parenthese as an arguement</li>
        
          <br>
          
          <li>Javascript operates code in order from top to bottom, unless conditional logic is used by using an "if" or an "else if" statement. The computer will determine if each statement is truthy before moving onto the next. When an "if" statement is evaluated as truthy then it will run the code associated with that condition and then break out of the "if" statement.</li>
        
          <br>
          
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data that is typically related. E.g. "var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];" This is useful for processing a large number of values as a singular variable</li>
        
          <br>
          
          <li>A "for" loop performs a task on all of the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed repeatedly. E.g. for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) This is broken into three statements, "var x = 0" which is the starting point. We declare a variable (x) and gave it a value of 0 which is the first index in an array. The second statement "x < shapes.length;" is a condition, as long as the number "x" in the variable is less than the "length" of the array the loop will keep running. The final statement "x++" (shortcut for x+1) is what allows the array to iterate over each item.  </li>
        
          <br>
          
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. Instead you must call a function by its name for it to run.</li>
