        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>

          <li>Section elements are semantic elements which define a section in a document with thematic content</li>

          <li>Semantic elements have names which describe its content and its role within a webpage. Semantic elements make a webpage more accesible and easier to read for other developers and also the browser</li>

          <li>Anything within the head element will not be displayed for the end user, it contains metadata for use by the browser</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>

          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>A period designates a term as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the stated class, e.g. .card  would gain the property assignments from the CSS</li>

          <li> There are three main methods to incorporate CSS into a html webpage, inline CSS which styles an element directly in the HTML file, an internal style sheet which contains css rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file, the rules only apply to that page. Lastly, there is the external CSS style sheet, this is preferred in most cases as it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file.</li>

          <li>git pull origin main: Pulls the latest version of the code from git, specifically for this example it will pull the main code</li>
