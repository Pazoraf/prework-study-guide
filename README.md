# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This is a webpage that I designed to store the notes that I took during the prework assignment with the edX skills bootcamp in Front-end Web Development. I was motivated to build this project by wanting to practice and apply the skills that I learnt during the assignment and to also have easy access to the notes and information that I obtained during the assignment. 
Being a digital based course, it made sense to have the notes stored digitally rather than physically, so then I can access them easily and also see how they apply practically. Through this assignment, I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript fundamentals, and was able to apply them practically, and also see how any problems or bugs that I might run into would be solved.

## Installation

## Usage

To use the Prework Study Guide, simply review the notes in each section on the webpage. If you open the DevTools console on Chrome (cmd+option+I for macOS, ctrl+shift+I for windows), It will list the topics that I studied, and it will suggest a random topic for you to study first.
